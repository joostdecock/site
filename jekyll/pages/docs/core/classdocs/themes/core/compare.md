## Description 

The [`Compare`](compare) theme merely extends the [`Sampler`](sampler) theme,
which itself extends the abstract [`Theme`](theme) class.

It does not provide any extra methods or code, but it does come
with its own template directory, including:


- footer-comments
- header-comments
- style.css
- svg-attributes

The compare theme is the standard freesewing theme, and generates basic SVG output.

## See also
The [`Sampler`](sampler) parent class.

The [`Theme`](theme) grandparent class.
