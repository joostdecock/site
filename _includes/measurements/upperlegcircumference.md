The **upper leg circumference** is the measurement around your leg, all the way at the top of your leg, at your crotch.

To measure your **upper leg circumference**, wrap the tape measure around your leg, 
and slide it up your leg as high as you can. Make sure to keep the tape measure horizontal to the floor as you measure the circumference of your leg.
