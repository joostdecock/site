Do you want the button placket to be sewn in place (classic style), or folded back and held in place by the buttons (seamless style)?

> Seamless is less work, and it looks great.
{:.tip}

> As seamless is only possible on a **cut-on** on placket, this option is ignored if you chose **seperate** as your button placket type.
{:.warning}
