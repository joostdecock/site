{% include pattern-option.html pattern='wahid' option='centerBackDart' %}

Since nobody has a perfectly straight back, this pattern tapers in with 0.5 cm at the center back of your neck.

> <h5>What's the point?</h5>
> If your back slumps forward a bit, fabric tends to pool at the back of your neck. With no sleeves or collar, this causes your neckline to gape.
> This option tapers the fabric inwards at the back of your neck. It does so by 0.5 cm by default, but you can increase of decrease that value.
