> <h5 class='notoc'>Why a stand-alone demo?</h5>
>
> The demo is part of the documentation, and included in the 
> docs repository. But that is a Jekyll-based site which means
> that running your own instance is going to require some work.
>
> If you want your own demo without the hassle, you can simply clone 
> this and open demo.html in your browser.
