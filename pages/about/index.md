## The freesewing origin story

Sewing is easy. It really is. 
What's hard is getting things to fit properly. 
That's why you use a sewing pattern. 
It's a blueprint for whatever it is you are making. 
A good pattern gives you good fit. Most patterns don't.

That's because &mdash; much like clothes in the shop &mdash; patterns come in sizes. 
And sizes are a crude way to put people in boxes. 
They are made for an imaginary average person, rather than for you.

There's another way, and that is to draft a pattern based on your measurements. 
These made-to-measure patterns are vastly superior, but they require a lot of work.

I wanted to change that, and that effort evolved into 
[MakeMyPattern.com](https://makemypattern.com/).
I ran that site for a number of years, and it was a remarkable success.
Probably helped by the fact that I gave away all patterns for free.

In the world of home sewing, it tends to require a bit of 
explaining why one would choose to give away their work for free. 
Things are different in the open source world where the idea of 
sharing your work with others for the benefit of all is 
the very thread from which communities are woven.

While I can't magically bring the culture of open source 
to sewing patterns, I certainly can bring sewing patterns 
into the open source world.

[Freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/) will continue to offer what 
[Makemypattern.com](https://makemypattern.com/) does today: 
free sewing patterns drafted to your measurements. 
But additionally, it will be open to your contributions.

Here's hoping that in the Venn diagram of the somewhat geeky and sewing, 
it's not just me in the middle.

### How is freesewing different?

What Freesewing does is comparable to what 
[Lekala](https://www.lekala.co/) does:
provide customized sewing patterns.

But there is one important difference: 

> Freesewing is free of charge. Our patterns are free ([CC-BY](/about/license)) and our code is free ([GPL-3](/about/license)).

This is not a business and is not about making money. Freesewing is a labour of love.

## Main parts
The freesewing project is made up of different parts:

### The core platform
Freesewing core is the open source platform that underpins all our work.
Its source code is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing).

As a platform is something you can use to build things on, freesewing core
is most valuable to people who like to build or create things.

If you're that kind of person, core might be for you.

### The patterns
Pattern design is a science. And like all sciences, the best way to get ahead
is to share our work and results openly with the community.

We design patterns to the best of our abilities, and share them freely because we 
are convinced that together with you, we can come up with far better results that 
on our own.

No graphical tools are used to create these patterns. The entire pattern is implemented in code.

It's an approach that is perhaps unusual (pattern designers are used to fire up Illustrator, not an 
<abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>) but fits particularly well with 
the engineering challenge that are sewing patterns.

Moving a line a bit right or left in a graphical program is subjective, 
and hard to reproduce. With code, you know what is going on and what you are changing to the 
very last detail.

### The documentation
This is certainly the most time-consuming work we do.
But we do it nevertheless because we believe it is important.

We try to document everything. From the code we write to how to sew up our patterns.
It's an ongoing process of tiny improvements that's never finished.

## What can freesewing do for me?

What's in it for you depends on what role you see yourself in.

### For makers

All our patterns are free of charge. We provide detailed instructions to make them into garments,
and can help when you get stuck.

We like to showcase makes from the community, and share your work on our 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) and 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freesewing_org/)
accounts. Or checkout the #freesewing hashtag.

### For designers

Designing patterns for the freesewing platform has a lot of advantages for you as a designer.

On the technical side, you have powerful tools at your disposal that take care of a lot
of things for you (no more grading, ever).

You can host your patterns at freesewing.org (for free) or run your own
instance, and sell them. Custom pattern drafts provide your customers 
with a better experience, but also protect you from people copying and passing your
patterns around. Which means you can sell more patterns at a lower price point.

### For developers

All our code is open source, and you can fork it [on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing).

We have documentation to help you use our code in your own projects. 
And our info service makes integration with your front-end child's play.

## How can I contribute to freesewing?

We welcome all contributions, and you might have more to offer than your realize.

For all details, please refer to the [contributors documentation](/contribute).

Or you can vote with your money and [make a donation](/donate).

We promise it will make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. Especially after
you read [our donations pledge](/about/pledge).
