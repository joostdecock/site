## Before you start

### What you need

To make Simon, you will need the following:

 - About two meters of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](#fabric-options)
 - Buttons
 - Fusable interfacing for collar and cuffs (and possibly for the front placket)

### Fabric options

Any fabric shop that is worth your business should have a shirting section. 
You can just walk in, ask where you can find the shirting, and pick out something you like.

Most of what you'll find there will be cotton, or a blend of cotton. 
But you're free to go for another fiber too.

When shopping online, it can be harder to get a good idea of what you're looking at. 
In the absence of touch, it's good to know a thing or two about the different weaves of fabrics. 
The weave is how the fabric was woven, and this determines not only how the fabric looks, but also how it will feel and drape.

> Without wanting to start an encyclopedia of fabrics here, here are some terms you may come across when shopping for shirt fabric online.
> 
> **Broadcloth or poplin**
> 
> Broadcloth is the way to go for that white shirt for your job interview or wedding.
> 
> Broadcloth (frequently referred to as poplin) is a simple weave and results in a flat plain fabric that will give you that crisp formal look.
> 
> It's typically a lighter fabric and in light colours can tend to be a bit transparant.
> 
> 
> **Twill**
> 
> You can recognize twill fabrics by their characteristic diagonal texture from the weave.
> 
> It drapes more easely than broadcloth, wrinkles less and when it does, is easier to iron.
> 
> The flip side of the coin is that it won't give you that starchy crisp vibe that broadcloth can.
> 
> 
> **Pinpoint**
> 
> Pinpoint is the work horse of shirt fabrics. Typically they produce a heavier and thicker . and thus more durable . fabric.
> 
> Pinpoint is a less formal look than broadcloth or twill, but more formal than ofxord. This, combined with its durability, make it a great choice for your everyday work shirt.
> 
> 
> **Chambray**
> 
> Chambray is simple weave, similar to broadcloth. It is different because it uses a much heavier yarn, and typically different colours for the weft and width.
> 
> The result is a much more textured fabric, both in touch as appearance where the different colours create a densly speckled two-coloured fabric.
> 
> 
> **Denim**
> 
> Denim needs no introduction. It's the stuff your jeans are made from.
> 
> Tecnically a twill fabric (look for the signature diagonal texture) denim is produced in much lighter weigths than the ones your jeans are made from. Those are the ones you can use for a shirt.
> 
> 
> **Flannel**
> 
> From Curt Cobain to the hipsters at your local coffee shop, they all swear by flannel shirts.
> 
> Warmer than any other option here, flannel comes typically in bruhed cotton though you might find it with added wool for extra warmth.
> 
> 
> **Linnen**
> 
> Linnen wrinkles like a mofo, but you can't beat it for safari looks.
> 
> The reason you associate it with adventures in tropical climates is that linnen breaths like nothing else and will keep you coolest of all.
> 
> 
> **Thread count**
> 
> A higher thread count means a smoother (and more expensive) fabric.
> 
> Thread count is expressed in numbers, like 60s, 80s, 100s and so on to 300s and more.
> 
> There's a catch though. Numbers above 100s are typically made my twisting two yarns together. Like a 160s thread count means that two 80s yarns were twisted together for the thread.
> 
> 
> **Single ply or Two ply**
> 
> If a thread is made up of two yarns (see thread count above) we call that Two ply.
> 
> If the yarn is made up of a single thread, it's call Single ply.
> 
> You can expect two ply to last longer, and be more expensive.

{:.cuts}

> When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together). 
> However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.
>
> When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.
{:.tip}

> <h5>Caveats</h5>
> - The **front right**, **front left**, and **sleeve** have seams that should be made into flat-felled seams. As such, they have extra seam allowance on those seams. When cutting out these pieces, you **must** include this extra seam allowance. 
> - The cuff guard and cuff placket have no seam allowance. That is normal, just cut them out as they are drawn on the pattern.
> - Do not cut out the darts in the **back** piece. You should mark them, but not cut them out.

## Construction

### Step 1: Fuse interfacing
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html

    url='/img/patterns/simon/1b.png'
    description='Fuse collar interfacing'
%}
</div>
</div>

#### Press interfacing to cuffs
To make two cuffs, you have cut out your cuff piece four times in fabric, and twice in interfacing.

For each cuff, press the interfacing piece to the bad side of the cuff piece.

> If the inside and outside of your cuff are the same fabric, it does not matter what cuff piece you press it to.
>
> However, a popular style detail is to have a different fabric for the inside of the cuff. In this case, make sure to press the interfacing to the piece that you want to be the outside of your cuff.
{:.tip}

> Depending on what cuff you have chosen, the shape of the cuff will be different.
>
> In the first illustration, you can see both a round barrel cuff and a French cuff as example.
>
> Going forward, the round barrel cuff will be used in the illustrations, but the process is the same for the other cuffs.
{:.comment}

#### Press interfacing to collar and undercollar, and collar stand
To make iyour collar, you need to cut one undercollar, one collar, and two collar stands. All of this both in fabric and interfacing.

For each piece, press the interfacing piece to the bad side.

### Step 2: Prepare the cuffs

#### Sew cuff together
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/2a.png'
    description='Sew cuff together'
%}
Place both parts of your cuff (one with interfacing, one without) toghether with the good sides, and sew them together at the standard seam allowance.

> <h5>Make sure to</h5>
>
> - Do not sew together the side that we will attach to the sleeve later
> - Stop at the seam allowance distance from the edge on the sleeve side
{:.warning}

#### Trim seam allowance
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/2b.png'
    description='Trim seam allowance'
%}
Before we are going to flip your cuff over, we need to trim back the seam allowance to remove bulk.

#### Press back seam allowance
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/2c.png'
    description='Press back seam allowance'
%}
Fold back the seam allowance on the sleeve side, and press it down.

> If you sewed too far along the edge earlier, you will have to unpick a few stitches.
{:.comment}

#### Turn cuff around and press
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/2d.png'
    description='Turn cuff around and press'
%}
Flip your cuff with the good sides out, and give it a good press.

> When pressing your cuffs, make sure to role the seam a bit to the backside of the cuff to guarantee that the inner fabric of the cuff is not visible.
{:.tip}

You can now put your cuffs aside, we'll attach them later.

### Step 3: Prepare the collar

#### Sew collar and undercollar together
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/3a.png'
    description='Sew collar and undercollar together'
%}
Place both collar parts toghether with the good sides, and sew them together at the standard seam allowance.

#### Trim seam allowance
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/3b.png'
    description='Trim seam allowance'
%}
Before we are going to flip your collar over, we need to trim back the seam allowance to remove bulk.

#### Turn collar and press
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/3c.png'
    description='Turn collar and press'
%}
Flip your collar with the good sides out, get those tips as pointy as possible, and give it a good press.

> When pressing your collar, remember that the undercollar is a bit more narrow.
> 
> When you align the non-sewn sides, this will cause the seam to roll towards the backside of the collar to guarantee that the inner fabric of the collar is not visible.
{:.tip}

#### Top-stitch collar
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/3d.png'
    description='Top-stitch collar'
%}
Top-stitch along the edge of the collar. This locks down the seam allowance and makes for a crisp look.

> How far you top-stitch from the edge is a style choice. It's often a bit less than the standard seam allowance. Have a look at some existing shirts to get an idea.
{:.comment}

### Step 4: Join collar and collar stand

#### Place collar between collar stands and baste in place
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/4a.png'
    description='Place collar between collar stands and baste in place'
%}
Mark the middle point of your collar and your collar stands with a pin.
First place a collar stand with the good side up, then your collar, and finally the second collar stand with the good side down.

You collar should sit between your two collar stands, and the middles (where you placed your pin) should be aligned.

> The way things look will depend a little bit on your collar choices, but in general your collar stand is going to bend downward, and your collar stand will bend upward.
> 
> To aling this all, we are going to baste this together, rather than pin it. Your collar is an important part of your shirt, so it's worth basting this.
{:.comment}

First, replace the pins marking the middle with a pin that pins all parts together.

Now, start basting from this pin and work your way to the corner of the collar, making sure to align both edges of the fabric.

When you reach the corner of your collar, keep going and baste the end of both collar stands together.

When you've done one side, start from your pin in the middle again and do this other side. When you're done basting, you can take out the pin.

#### Sew your collar to the collar stands
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/4b.png'
    description='Sew your collar to the collar stands'
%}
Sew along the edge of your collar stand, respecting the standard seam allowance.

> Make sure to stop 2cm before the edge (twice the standard seam allowance) as we'll be folding the seam allowance over in the next step, and we need to leave the collar stands seperated enough to slide the shirt in between them later.
{:.warning}

#### Fold back and press the collar stand seam allowance
Fold back the seam allowance of your collar stand on the non-sewn side and press it down.

> In the center part, pressing down the seam allowance will be easy. But towards the tips of your collar, doing so will be tricky without pressing folds in your collar.
> 
> Press is as best as you can without making folds in your collar. We'll press this again after flipping the collar out.
{:.comment}

#### Turn collar stand and press
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/4c.png'
    description='Turn collar and press'
%}
Flip your collar stand with the good sides out, and give it a good press. Make sure to keep the seam allowance on the collar stand folded inwards.

You can now put your collar aside, we'll attach it later.

### Step 5: Optional: Sew in your label
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/5.png'
    description='Sew in your label'
%}

Our next step is to attach the yoke. But the yoke is a great place to put your label. So if you'd like to do that, we might as well start with that.

Pick one yoke, and you can sew your label on it in the center (on the good side).

### Step 6: Join the yokes to the back
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/6a.png'
    description='Join the yokes to the back'

<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/6b.png'
    description='Press the yoke'
%}
</div>
</div>

Place one yoke with the good side up. On top of that, place your back with the good side up, aligning the seam where it needs to be attached to the yoke.

Finally, place your second yoke on top of the back, but with the good side down.

You back should now be sandwidched between the good sides of your two yokes.

If that's the case, sew them in place along the back/yoke seam, making sure to respect the seam allowance.

> <h5>Keep your label on the inside</h5>
> If you added a lable in step 1, make sure to put the yoke with your label at the bad side of your back. 
{:.warning}

When you're done, don't forget to give it a good press to make the seam lie flat.

### Step 7: Edge-stitch the yoke
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/7.png'
    description='Edge-stitch the yoke'
%}

With your yokes attached to the back, we are going to edge-stitch along the seam we just made, on the yoke side.

> Fold the inner yoke out of the way. Our edge stitching will catch outer yoke, back and all the seam allowances, but not the inner yoke.
{:.tip}

Just sew right next to the seam joining the outer yoke to the back.

> Edge-stitching is like top-stitching, but right next to the seam 
{:.comment}

### Step 8: Close the back darts

</div>

> <h5>You may be able to skip this step</h5>
> While this step is not optional, you may still be able to skip it because your pattern migth not have back darts at all. In that case, proceed to the next step. 
{:.comment}

Your pattern may or may not have back darts. If it has them, you should close them now.

Place your back down with the good side up, and fold it back from the side seam so the fold runs from the top to the bottom of your dart.

Do the same for the other dart, so that both sides are folded back.

Feel free to gently press in this crease, it will help you to neatly sew the darts.

Sew across the line marking the dart to close the darts. Be careful to make sure the top and bottom of your darts are precisely where they need to be. If one dart sits higher than the other, it will look bad.

When you're done, don't forget to give it a good press. Press the extra fabric of the dart towards the side seams.

### Step 9: Prepare the button placket

> If you have chosen a grown-on placket, you can skip the first two sub-steps and skip ahead to [Fold the button placket](#fold-the-button-placket). 
{:.comment}

#### Sew on the button placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/9a.png'
    description='Sew on the button placket'
%}
If you have chosen a seperate button placket, sew it to the Front Right piece.

Place the Front Right (piece 1) down with the good side up, and place the Button Placket (piece 1b) on top of it with the good side down, making sure to align the seam.

Sew it in place with the default seam allowance.

#### Press seam allowance to placket side
Place your front with the good side down, and press the seam allowance to the button placket side.

#### Fold the button placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/9b.png'
    description='Fold the button placket'
%}

Now, fold over the button placket on the first fold line, and press this fold in place.

Then, fold the placket over again, making sure to have the fabric extend just beyond the seam that joins your placket to the front.

When you're happy, press the folded placket.

#### Sew down the folded placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/9c.png'
    description='Sew down the folded placket'
%}

> This is the classic aproach. If you have chosen the seamless Button placket style, you don't have to do this.
> 
> Rather than sew the placket down, simply leave it folded. The folds will be secured in place when we attach the buttons later. 
{:.comment}

From the good side of your shirt, sew down the folded placket by stitching in the ditch.

To do so, sew exactly on top of your earlier seam. Since you folded the fabric of your placket a bit passed this seam, it will get caught at the back, fixing your folded placket in place, and locking the seam allowance inside.


### Step 10: Prepare the buttonhole placket

> If you have chosen a grown-on placket, you can skip the first two sub-steps and skip ahead to Understanding a classic buttonhole placket. 
{:.comment}

#### Sew on the buttonhole placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/10a.png'
    description='Sew on the buttonhole placket'
%}
If you have chosen a seperate buttonhole placket, sew it to the Front Left piece.

Place the Front Left (piece 2) down with the good side up, and place the Buttonhole Placket (piece 2b) on top of it with the good side down, making sure to align the seam.

Sew it in place with the default seam allowance.

When you're done, don't forget to give it a good press. Press the seam allowance towards the placket side.

#### Press seam allowance to the placket side
Place your front with the good side down, and press the seam allowance to the buttonhole placket side.

#### Understanding a classic buttonhole placket

> If you have chosen a seamless placket, you should follow the steps of the button placket, as the construction is identical.
> 
> The steps below are for a classic buttonhole placket. 
{:.comment}

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/10b.png'
    description='Understanding a classic buttonhole placket'
%}

Your placket has a bunch of lines on it, so let's first clarify what they are:

 - The buttonhole line has long dashes with buttonholes on it. It marks where the buttonholes should go
 - The two fold lines have long dashes and sit at an equal distance right and left of the buttonhole line
 - The two+two sew lines are dotted lines that sit at an equal distance of each fold line

#### Trim back seam allowance
> If you have chosen a grown-on placket, this does not apply. 
{:.comment}
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/10c.png'
    description='Trim back seam allowance'
%}

The seam allowance of where you sewed your buttonhole placket to your front should fit inside your folded placket.

For that, trim back the seam allowance so that it doesn't extend beyond the first fold line on the placket.

#### Fold the buttonhole placket
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

</div>
</div>
Fold the placket on the first fold line. Press the fold in place.

Then, fold the part you just folded again, this time on the second fold line. Press this fold in place too.

> When your placket is folded and pressed, place a few pins along the lenght of your placket to keep things from shifting around

Sew on the first sew line, closest to the edge.

Then, flip your shirt over so that the good side is up, and your placket is up too. Then sew on the second sew line.

> Thise two lines of top-stitching will always be visible, so make sure to keep it neat

Now press that baby. You know you want to.

### Step 11: Close the shoulder seams

>
> We are going to close the shoulder seams with a technique that is commonly know as the **burrito method**.
>
> If you are familiar with the burrito method, you aready know what to do. If not, read on for a clever way to neatly close your shirt's shoulder seams while locking all the unfinished edges out of sight.
{:.comment}

#### Pin the fronts to the outside yoke
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/11a.png'
    description='Pin the fronts to the outside yoke'

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/11b.png'
    description='Pin the fronts to the outside yoke'
%}
</div>
</div>

Place your back down with the good side up, but be careful to fold the inner yoke downward (as illustrated by the dotted line.

Place your fronts on your back, with the good sides down. Pin fronts to the yoke at the shoulder seam, good sides together.

#### Roll, roll, roll your shirt, pin down and sew your seam
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/11c.png'
    description='Pin the fronts to the outside yoke'
%}
Roll up your back and fronts starting at the hem. Roll them into a neat sausage upwards until you can see the entire turned down yoke.

Now, you can flip the inner yoke over your rolled sausage to align the shoulder seams with the other yoke and fronts.

Pin them in place, and then sew the shoulder seams, making sure to keep your sausage (or burrito stuffing) out of the way so it doesn't get caught in the seam.

#### Flip it inside out through the neck opening
When you've sewn both shoulder seams, reach in through the neck opening, and pull out the back and front parts to inside-out your burrito.

#### Press the shoulder seams
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/11c.png'
    description='Press the shoulder seams'
%}
You did all this work, so now make sure you make it look super sharp by giving it a good press. Make sure that the seam allowance between your yokes lies nice and flat for that.

### Step 12: Edge-stitch the shoulder seams of the yoke
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/12.png'
    description='Edge-stitch the shoulder seams of the yoke'
%}

Just as we've edge-stitched the bottom seam of the yoke in Step 3, we're going to edge-stitch the yoke at the shoulder seams too.

Since you've just pressed these shoulder seams, everything should lie nice and flat, and you just need to run a stitch right next to the seam.

> Make sure to edge-stitch on the yoke part, where you will catch all the seam allowance, and not on the front part. 
{:.warning}

### Step 13: Construct the sleeve placket

#### Sew in the cuff guard
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">

    description='Edge-stitch the cuffguard in place'
%}
</div>
</div>

 - Place your sleeve with the good side down, and your cuff guard on top, also with the good side down.
 - Align the edge of your cuff guard with the cut in your sleeve, on the side shortest to the side seam.
 - Now sew along the fold line marked on the cuff guard, closest to the edge.

> If during cutting out your pattern pieces you had not cut into your sleeve on the line where the sleeve placket needs to be put in, you need to do that first. 
{:.tip}

 - Fold over the cuff guard, and press down this seam.
 - Turn your sleeve over with the good side up, and bring your cuff guard through the slit in your sleeve.
 - Fold it twice on the lines so that the unfinished seam is tucked inwards.
 - Make your folds so that the upper folds sits ever so slightly further than the seam you already made.
 - Press everything down, and then edge-stitch the cuff guard in place.

#### Fold and press the placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/13d.png'
    description='Fold and press the placket'
%}
Origami time! We're going to fold the sleeve placket using the marked foldlines as our guide. This will be a lot easier if you press between each fold.

 - First, fold the outer edges of the placket inwards.
 - Next, fold the entire thing double.
 - Then, fold down both tips into a nice pointy shape.
 - Now give it a final good press.

Place your sleeve down with the good side up. The guard we have sewn in earlier sits against the other unfinished fabric edge of where you cut into your sleeve.

Place your placket around that edge, one side above it, one underneath.

You need to slide the placket onto your sleeve until the middle of it (the tip) aligns with the cut in your sleeve.

The idea is that the placket closes up the unfinished edge, but also covers the guard of the other edge.

When you've got it where you want it, pin the placket down.

#### Sew the sleeve placket
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/13g.png'
    description='Sew the sleeve placket'
%}

Start at the edge of the sleeve (the bottom of the sleeve placket) and edge-stitch along the edge upwards.

Go around the tip, and come down again on the other side (the fold side) until you have passed the point where your guard ends.

Then, sew horizontal to the other side of the placket to finish.

> I have included an extra illustration here that only shows the outline of the placket. You can see that the end of the guard is caught in our stitching of the placket, and is thus neatly tucked away.

### Step 14: Set in sleeves

#### Remember, this is a flat-felled seam

    description='Aligning the fabric for a flat-felled seam'
%}

> <h5>Careful with the extra seam allowance for the flat-felled seam</h5>
> There is extra seam allowance on the sleeve to allow for the creation of the flat-felled seam.
> 
> As such, be careful to not align the fabric edge, but align the seam so that the sleeve sits out 1cm.
{:.warning}

#### Pin shirt in place
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/14a.png'
    description='Pin shirt in place'
%}
Spread your shirt open so that both fronts and back lie flat with their good sides up.

Now place your sleeve on top with the good side down, matching the notch at the top of the sleeve with the shoulder seam.

> Be careful, your sleeve is not symmetric, so be sure to have the double notch (and cuff guard) on the back side, and the single notch on the front side.
>
> Also note that the double notches on the back of your sleeve do not have corresponding notches on the back. That's because it should match op with the seam where your yoke joins the back.
{:.warning}

You now need to pin the sleeve to the armhole. To do so, make sure to:

 - Match the start and end of the sleevehead to the start and end of the armhole
 - Match the notches on the sleevehead to the notches on the back and fronts
 - Distribute the sleevecap ease between the notches as shown

#### Distribute sleavecap ease
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/14b.png'
    description='Distribute the sleeevecap ease'
%}
The default sleevecap ease for this pattern is 0.5cm. If you have sleevecap ease, you need to distribute that extra length evenly between the notches as shown.

> <h5>About sleevecap ease</h5>
> If you are unsure what sleevecap ease is, have a look at the [documentation for the sleevecap ease pattern option](/fixme).
>
{:.question}

#### Sew sleeve in armhole
When you've got your sleeve neatly pinned in your armhole, sew it in place. Be careful to avoid any pleats in the part between the notches where you need to ease in the sleevecap ease.

> Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway: Repeat this step for the other sleeve.

### Step 15: Flat-fell armhole seam

#### Press seam allowance to one side
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/15a.png'
    description='Press seam allowance to one side'
%}
Lay down your freshly sewn sleeve seam with the good side down

We are going to press the seam allowance to one side. To do so, identify the seam allowance that is wider (for the flat-felled seam).

The longer seam allowance needs to lie on top of the shorter (standard seam allowance).

Once you have verified that, press down the seam allowance.

#### Fold under extra seam allowance
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/15b.png'
    description='Fold under extra seam allowance'
%}
Now, fold the extra seam allowance for the flat-felled seam under the standard seam allowance.

You can use pins to hold this in place, but it's simpler to just press it.

> This will be relatively easy on the straight parts of the seam, but a bit more tricky at the curved sections. Take your time, and if needed you can cut into the extra seam allowance to allow it to flare open, or bend.
{:.comment}

#### Sew the flat-felled seam
Now, from the bad side of the fabric, sew the seam allowance down just at the edge where it folds under the other seam allowance.

Important here it to keep an even distance from the seam of your sleeve. If you have a felling foot for your sewing machine, it will help you with that. But if not, just be careful.

> It is more important to keep and even distance from the sleeve seam than to sew exactly at the edge of the fold. Ideally, the fold sits at an even distance anyhere, but if it doesn't, just make sure to sew parallel to the sleeve seam. Even if that means you deviate a bit from the folded edge.
{:.tip}

#### Press the flat-felled seam
When it's all done, press the flat-felled seam from the good side so it lies nice and flat.

### Step 16: Close the side/sleeve seams

</div>
Place your shirt with the good sides together, and sew the side and sleeve seams to close the shirt.

> <h5>Careful with the extra seam allowance for the flat-felled seam</h5>
> There is extra seam allowance on the sleeve and front sides to allow for the creation of the flat-felled seam.
>
> As such, be careful to not align the fabric edge, but align the seam so that the extra seam allowance sits out 1cm.

### Step 17: Flat-fell the side/sleeve seams

#### Press seam allowance to one side
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/15a.png'
    description='Press seam allowance to one side'
%}
We are going to press the seam allowance to one side. To do so, identify the seam allowance that is wider (for the flat-felled seam).

The longer seam allowance needs to lie on top of the shorter (standard seam allowance).

Once you have verified that, press down the seam allowance.

#### Fold under extra seam allowance
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/15b.png'
    description='Fold under extra seam allowance'
%}
Now, fold the extra seam allowance for the flat-felled seam under the standard seam allowance.

You can use pins to hold this in place, but it's simpler to just press it.

> This will be relatively easy on the straight parts of the seam, but a bit more tricky at the curved sections. Take your time, and if needed you can cut into the extra seam allowance to allow it to flare open, or bend.

#### Press the flat-felled seam
When it's all done, press the flat-felled seam from the good side so it lies nice and flat.

### Step 18: Attach cuffs to sleeves

#### Pin cuff in place
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/18a.png'
    description='Pin cuff in place'
%}
You need to insert the sleeve between the two layers of your cuff, making sure that that good side of the fabric sits against the side of your cuff that has the interfacing applied to it.

You will need to pin this in place, because depending on how long your sleeve placket is, it might be hard or even impossible to get this to lie flat.

Also note that your sleeve edge will be longer than your cuff (how much longer depends on the sleeve drape). You need to make one or a few folds in your sleeve to accomodate for this.

> Your pattern contains helplines on the sleeve to help you place to folds.
{:.tip}

> Take your time to pin everything carefully in place. We are goint to edge-stitch this later, so it's important that front and back of your cuff align nicely.
{:.comment}

#### Edge-stitch cuffs to sleeves
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/18b.png'
    description='Edge-stitch cuffs to sleeves'
%}
Once everything is pinned in place, edge stitch along the edge of your cuff to attach it to your sleeve.

It's important to catch both outer and inner layer of your cuff on the edge.

> Make sure to edge-stitch from the outer layer side (the good side of your sleeve) and keep it parallel with your cuff edge.
{:.tip}

When you're done, give your cuffs a good press.

#### Top-stitch the cuffs
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/18c.png'
    description='Top-stitch the cuffs'
%}

> Make sure to press your cuffs before you do this.
{:.warning}

Top-stitch around your cuff at a distance from the edge that is a bit less than your seam allowance. Go all the way around your cuff.

### Step 19: Attach the collar

#### Baste collar in place
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/19a.png'
    description='Baste collar in place'
%}
This is an important seam, so we are going to baste this in place to make sure it sits exactly right before we sew it.

Start at the center back, and place the seam alowance of your back part between your two collar stands. Work your way around one side, and then do the other.

Make sure to respect the standard seam allowance and - important - avoid any wrinkles.

> While your collar stand is relatively straight, we are going to sew it to what is essentially a hole in your shirt.
>
> That's a bit tricky, so take extra care at those parts that are most curved: where the back joins the fronts. 
{:.comment}

#### Edge-stitch collar in place
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/19b.png'
    description='Edge-stitch collar in place'

<div class="col-md-6">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/19c.png'
    description='Edge-stitch collar in place'
%}
</div>
</div>
When you're happy with how you've basted your collar in place, it's time to sew that thing down.

We're going to start at center-back and sew all the way around the collar stand.

#### Sew along the collar edge
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/19d.png'
    description='Sew along the collar edge'
%}
To give more body to your collar, and firmly secure it in place we're going to sew along the top edge of the collar stand.

Sew about half the seam allowance from your earlier edge-stitching. Make sure to stop a few cm before the end of the collar.

> You need to stop a few cm before the end of the collar (note: the end of the collar, not the end of the collar stand) so that this seam is entirely covered when the collar is folded down. 
{:.warning}

#### Press the collar
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/19e.png'
    description='Press the collar'
%}
Now that your collar is attached, give it a good press.

### Step 20: Hem your shirt

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/20a.png'
    description='Fold over and press'

<div class="col-md-4">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/20b.png'
    description='Fold over again, and press again'
%}
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/simon/20c.png'
    description='Sew the hem'
%}
</div>
</div>
Time to finish the hem (that's the part you tuck in your trousers).

Fold uphalf of the hem allowance and press down. Then, fold up again and press again.

Now, sew along upper edge to finish the hem.

### Step 21: Create buttonholes
If you haven't done so initially, mark all the places you should have buttonholes.

They sit along the front closure and at your cuffs.

When you've marked them, make buttonholes there.

### Step 22: Attach buttons
Pin your shirt closed to transfer the place of the buttonholes to the button sides.

When you've marked where buttons should go, sew them on.

> Rather than mark the location of the buttons from the pattern, I prefer to transfer the location of the created buttonholes.
>
> This way, if a buttonhole sits a little bit out of place, the button will simply follow it.
