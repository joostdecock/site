## The pledge

I, Joost De Cock, maintainer of the freesewing project and 
recipient of its donations, hereby pledge that all donations
will be passed on to
[Doctors Without Borders (MSF)](http://www.msf.org/).

## The details
Once per year, all donations received in the previous 12 months
will be transferred to MSF.

This happens every year on 10 December.


## Caveat
TL;DR: I will donate 100% of what I receive, but that is not 100% of what you give.

When you donate, PayPal charges a fee. 
The donations pledge only applies to the money received, and not to the fee charged.

Historically, I have donated 100% of donations given, and paid the difference 
(the total of fees) out of my own pocket.

I hope to continue to do that, because I like the idea that 100% of what you
give goes to charity.

However, I cannot pledge this,because if this project becomes wildly successful,
it would bankrupt me to pay the transaction fee on all donations.
