## About

This privacy notice describes the personal data we store.
It outlines why we need the data, how long we keep it, and whether we share it with any third-parties.

We are confident it will demonstrate our commitment to privacy. 

## Part 1: How we use your personal data

For clarity, we've broken this up in three different types of roles:

 - For visitors, we store [visitor data](#visitor-data)
 - For users, we store [profile data](#profile-data)
 - For users with one or more models, we store [model data](#model-data)

These roles are cumulative. If you are a user, you are also a visitor.
And if you are a user with one or more models, you are also a user, and also a visitor.

>  - **Why do we need it?**
>    - We need the body measurements to draft made-to-measure sewing patterns
>    - We use the information about whether a model has breasts to only show relevant measurements when configuring the model
>    - The model avatar only serves to help you differentiate between your different models
>  - **How long do we keep it?**
>    - We keep model data up to 12 months after your last login, or until you remove it.

## Part 2: Other topics

### Full disclosure

If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform both you and the authorities.

If you believe your personal data has been compromised, please contact joost@decock.org.


### Service Providers

Our hosting provider manages our backend systems for us. This includes hosting, storage, and backup. 

While this means they process your data (in the strict sense of the word), they do not require access to information about you. 
Furthermore, as we encrypt profile data at rest, it is non-trivial for them to access it even if they wanted to.

### Law enforcement

While we have no intention of sharing any of your personal data, we are not above the law.

If we are required to do so by law, or if we feel that doing so would be the lesser evil, we will disclose personal data.

So far, we have not received any request from law enforcement to disclose information about one of our users.
We have also not disclosed any personal information for any other reason.

### Use by minors under the age of 16

You need to be at least 16 years old to use freesewing.

### Data Controller and Contact information

For questions about this privacy notice, you can contact Joost De Cock at joost@decock.org.

### Changes and Updates to this Policy

This policy may be updated occasionally. We will indicate this in the **Last update** data at the top of this document.
