Do you want classic buttonhole placket, or a seamless one (sometimes called French style)?

> #### Why pick classic?

> Because you're a classic kinda person, and that's what you want.

> As seamless is only possible on a grown on placket, this option is ignored if you chose sewn on as your buttonhole placket type.
