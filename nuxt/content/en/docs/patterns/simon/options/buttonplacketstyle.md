Do you want the button placket to be sewn in place (classic style), or folded back and held in place by the buttons (seamless style)?

>  Seamless is less work, and it looks great.

>  As seamless is only possible on a <strong>cut-on</strong> on placket, this option is ignored if you chose <strong>seperate</strong> as your button placket type.
