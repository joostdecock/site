### What you need

To make Benjamin, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 0.5 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric-options)). Left over 
pieces of a recent project could work too.
- About the same amount of interfacing

- Optionally: Bow tie adjustment ribbon and hardware

### Precision
Since a bow tie is a rather small item, precission with sewing is key to a good result. Any
slight difference between the upper and lower part of the bow will stand out. To get a great
result I found it very helpful to trace the actual seam lines onto the interfacing and follow
that while sewing.

### Press wisely
Later in the construction steps, you will be asked to press your fabric. Please be careful 
that you are not using too much heat on a delicate fabric that can't handle it.

It's a good idea to try pressing some fabric scraps before you start. This will allow you to 
figure out what is a good heat setting for the fabric you are using.

### Fabric options

#### Bow tie fabric
The bow ties you find in the store are typically make out of silk or some imitation silk poly. 
So it will come as no surprise that those are good options. Any type of fabric that you like
the pattern or looks of can become a candidate for a bow tie. The only real limitation is 
that the bow tie will have to be turned inside out through a tube that is only 2cm across. 
With some thicker fabrics, this will be a difficult proposition. 

Bow ties are more whimsical than normal ties, so having a fun pattern or loud colour is not
as much of a problem as it would be with a regular tie. 

Silk and silk imitation is slippery and tricky to work with. This can be compensated for with 
a fusible interfacing.

#### Interfacing

Depending on the fabric you chose for your bow tie, you will probably need interfacing. Interfacing
comes in two main types; fusible and sew-in. 

The fusible variety has some adhesive attached to one side that is activated with the heat 
of your iron. This attaches the interfacing to the fabric and the two can then be used as one. 
Fusible interfacing can be a great option if your fabric allows the heat required, and you 
use a quality interfacing. Some lesser quality interfacings can have the adhesive detach, 
and this shows as bubbles on the fabric surface later on in the life of your bow tie. Good
quality interfacings and correctly following the guidelines for adhering the interfacing 
will not present these problems.

Sew-in interfacing is sew into place before the fabric pieces are used. You attach the 
interfacing to the fabric by sewing the two together inside the seam allowance. If you use
a seam allowance of 6mm, you will sew the interfacing at 3mm. 
Anything may work as a sew-in interfacing, including an extra layer of the same fabric. 

The key part of the interfacing is to give your bow tie the structure you like. You can have 
a bow tie that stands proud and crisp. Or one that droops a bit at the tips. This is all about
your preference. 

It is good to experiment with the interfacing on a scrap piece of your fabric, specially with
the fusible kind. You want ot make sure you get the structure you like before commiting it 
to your pattern pieces.

Although the pattern calls for applying interfacing to all parts, if you have thick or stiff 
fabric, you may be able to only do one side, or no sides at all.

#### Choosing your grain

This pattern includes a grain line. This grain line is mostly there to be used with 
the interfacing. Since each pattern piece is interfaced, the grain line of the fabric 
itself is not so important. You can even change this from the standard for more 
informal impressions.

> If this all sounds very confusing, might I suggest reading the help 
page on [Fabric grain](/docs/sewing/fabric-grain).

#### Bow tie adjustment ribbon

This pattern allows you to make a bow tie that is the right length for a certain neck
size. It can also make one that has a ribbon and hardware that makes the bow tie
adjustable to different neck sizes. This is useful if not all of your shirts have
the same neck measurements, or if you sometimes like shirt with more ease in the
neck.

These ribbons can be found in the better haberdasheries or can be ordered online.

#### Seam allowance

Since the bow tie is constructed with the right sides of the fabric against each other,
the whole thing will have to be turned inside out. You probably want to consider using 
a small seam allowance of 6mm (¼ inch) to reduce the bulk.

## Construction

### All options

#### Step 1: Apply interfacing
Apply interfacing to all parts that you decided need it.

### Without adjustment ribbon

#### Step 2: Sew the knot to the collar band

Put the collar band part on the bow tie knot part, right sides together. 
Allign the ends of both parts. Now sew across the end to join the parts.

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step12.png'
    description="Sew the collar band to the knot"
%}
Do this for each end on both collar bands.

Press open all the seams.

You now have two identical single sided bow ties.

#### Step 3: Join both sides

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step13.png'
    description="Sew both sides together"
%}

Lay both the sides you made on top of each other, right sides together. Sew all 
along, but leaving an area of 5cm open in the middle of the collar band. Through
this opening we will turn the bow tie right side out.

#### Step 4: Turning

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step14.png'
    description="Clip seam allowance"
%}

Clip the seam allowance back in the usual spots and make little cuts to allow for
a smooth curves. 

Then use the back of a large crochet hook, or some other appropriately long skinny 
object, to turn the two sides right-side-out through the little opening. Start by 
gently pulling the two fabric pieces at the end of the bow apart. Then push the
end of the bow up between the two pieces of fabric. Keep gently pushing while 
pulling the rest of the tie down over it. This can be a tedious procedure. Take
your time and be gentle. It's easy to push too hard and rip stitches or fabric.

Once you have the tie right side out, make sure you push all the corners and sides 
out before giving it a good press.

#### Step 5: Closing

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step15.png'
    description="Closing the bow tie"
%}

Now all that is left is closing the litle hole we used to turn the bow tie 
right side out. You can do this by hand with a slip stitch, or a ladder stitch.
Or you can use the machine and stitch right at the edge of the band. Since this 
will normally be hidden by the collar of your shirt, it will not be all that obvious.

Now give it one last press and admire your work.

### With adjustment ribbon

#### Step 2: Attaching the ribbon

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step22.png'
    description="Sew the ribbon to part 1"
%}

The first thing to do is to sew the adjustment ribbon to the shortest of the bow
parts. The ribbon should be 290mm long. If it is different, you have to make sure
that you align it such that the ribbon and short bow piece together are as long as 
the long bow piece. 

Put right sides of the short bow piece and the ribbon together. 

Now sew across the end to join the parts.

#### Step 3: Join both sides

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step23.png'
    description="Sew both sides together"
%}

Lay both the parts of the medium bow on top of each other, right sides together. 
And lay the long bow on top of the ribbon and short bow part, also rights sides 
together.

Sew all along, but leave the short ends open. Through these openings we will turn 
the bow tie parts right side out.

#### Step 4: Turning

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step14.png'
    description="Clip seam allowance"
%}

Clip the seam allowance back in the usual spots and make little cuts to allow for
a smooth curves. 

Then use the back of a large crochet hook, or some other appropriately long skinny 
object, to turn the two parts right-side-out through the ends. Start by 
gently pulling the two fabric pieces at the end of the bow apart. Then push the
end of the bow up between the two pieces of fabric. Keep gently pushing while 
pulling the rest of the tie down over it. This can be a tedious procedure. Take
your time and be gentle. It's easy to push too hard and rip stitches or fabric.

Once you have the part right side out, make sure you push all the corners and sides 
out before giving it a good press.

Do this with both parts.

#### Step 5: Add hardware

Now we need to add the two pieces of hardware that make the bow tie adjustable. 
The oval looking piece will be attached to the part without the adjustment ribbon. 
And the piece with the T shaped attachment will go on the part with the ribbon.

First do the part without the ribbon. This is because the fabric tail of the 
ribbon piece will have to go through the oval part before sewing on its hardware.
If you would do it in the other sequence, you may not be able to feed it through.

To finish the ends, we're going to fold the fabric in three steps:

{% include figure.html
    url='/img/patterns/benjamin/step25.png'
    description="Three steps to fold, one step to sew"
%}

First we fold the side in under an angle. Then we fold the end over by just a small
seam allowance, something like 5mm. Then we fold it over again, for about 1cm. 
Finally we stick the oval ring under this last fold and stitch across.

Now feed the ribbon piece through the oval part and we finish it the same way.

Hook the T in one of the adjustment holes and your bow tie is done!
