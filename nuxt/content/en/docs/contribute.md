## Code of conduct

Freesewing strives to be an open and inclusive community.
To keep the trolls at bay, there's a [code of conduct](/docs/about/code-of-conduct). 
and contributors are expected to uphold it.

## Where to get help or report a problem

- The [freesewing chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing) is the best place to ask questions, 
meet other freesewers, or just hang out and share a laugh.
- Chat not your thing? The [@freesewing_org](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) 
Twitter account is the next best thing.
- Did you spot a mistake? Have a suggestion for an improvement? 
Please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/site/issues/new). 
You'll need a GitHub account, but they are free.

### Help spread the word

Tell your friends about freesewing, or spread awareness on social media. 
If you have a blog, perhaps you can write about us, or review one of our patterns.

It may seem simple, but it's probably how you heard about us in the first place. So pay it forward. 

### Improve our content

On every page, there's a button in the right column that allows you to submit improvements.
You'll need a GitHub account for this, but they are free.

Use that button. Don't be shy. If you see a typo, or something that needs clarification or more detail, please suggest your improvements.

Our content is written in Markdown, which is trivial to edit. 

> Our [documentation for translating MarkDown](/docs/i18n/markdown) has an overview of MarkDown syntax.

### Help with translating the site

The [freesewing translators team](/i18n/) can always use a helping hand. Maybe we can even add a new language thanks to you.

> See our [documentation for translators](/docs/i18n/) for mode details.

### Test, make, or showcase our patterns

We'd love to get pictures to [showcase](/showcase) on the site too.
